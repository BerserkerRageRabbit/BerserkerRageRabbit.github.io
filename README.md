This is my Get Dancing Project. I was sent instructions on how to proceed, but i didn't like the tempo. So i ignored it and it made this track like 100x better.

I did pretty much what everyone else did, otherwise.
Mr. D asked us to be creative, though, and edit and move around tracks so we don't listen to the same track over and over again; so i did the best i could to ensure that.

I also didn't like the higher notes on the bassline so I remade it using a portion of the notes.


I was afraid the assignment would be docked points if i didn't use the actual entire bassline as the assignment specified, though, at least once, so i incorporated it the best i could.

The drum intro also seemed kind of plain, and before i knew that i was supposed to follow instructions and create a certain track, i had been messing around with some of the drums so i still went with it afterward while trying to stay within the guidelines.

One of the most refreshing and least stressful parts of this assignment were the piano segment and the arpeggios. At this point, I had built my foundation and the decorating part was a piece of cake.

I honestly didn't find a problem with any of the audio on any of the tracks, so i didn't do much in terms of mastering and mixing.
