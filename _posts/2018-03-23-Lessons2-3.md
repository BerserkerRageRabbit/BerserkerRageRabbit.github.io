### The first thing i did was open up a piano track isolate the Skyline piano sample so that i could try to identify the chords being played by the piano. I didn't know how to play one of the chords, so i looked it up on the internet real quick and i then knew what to play.

### Next thing i did was record the guitar tracks. It took a couple of tries, it still wasn't perfect but i got a pretty good track down.

### My guitar is not the best, so the recording doesn't sound amazing, but i messed with the equalizer a bit until it sounded pretty good.

### I was going for a litle bit of a flamenco feel. I didn't quite hit it on the nose, but it sounds fairly decent and fills it in a bit. I wish the recording sounded more realistic like an acoustic guitar, but at least i'll get credit hopefully.
